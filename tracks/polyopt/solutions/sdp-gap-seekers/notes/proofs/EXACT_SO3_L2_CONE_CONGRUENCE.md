# Exact SO(3) `l=2` cone-congruence gate

## Purpose

The exact nontrivial-character stabilizer split retains four discrete pieces
of each continuous-spin `l=2` multiplicity space: one S3-standard cone in the
trivial V4 character and one stabilizer-plus cone in each of the three
nontrivial V4 characters. Their dimensions agree, but dimension agreement is
not a coefficient proof and does not authorize removing a PSD constraint.

The direct 38-cone solve reached 509,850,832 KiB before iteration zero. The
next decision-relevant question is therefore whether these four cones become
the same affine PSD matrix after the already-proved exact SO(3) rank-four
moment projection.

## Fail-closed test

For each positive family and spatial parity, the implementation:

1. erases spin-axis labels from every underlying state-polynomial row while
   retaining sites, state-symbol grouping, operator support, spatial parity,
   and exact integer combination coefficients;
2. requires a unique bijection from every nontrivial stabilizer-plus row to
   the S3-standard multiplicity row with the same spin-blind signature;
3. reconstructs both affine matrix entries exactly;
4. applies `T_xxxx = T_xxyy + T_xyxy + T_xyyx` entrywise; and
5. expands each row into the common integer source basis and computes its
   exact squared norm; and
6. verifies the positive diagonal congruence
   `T_ij = sqrt(n_i n_j / m_i m_j) R_ij` entrywise.

If a scale product is irrational, both rational polynomial entries must be
exactly zero. Unit-equal, nonunit-scaled, irrational-zero, sign-opposite, and
unmatched entries are counted separately. Only zero opposite and zero
unmatched entries set the truth result to exact. There are 12 target blocks
and 940,050 mapped triangle entries at `L=2,d=2`. Cone removal is guarded by
the exact result and is disabled in the truth-only jobs.

## L=1 controls

SCNet job `118194879`, source commit `81a1875`, proved all 12 spin-blind row
maps bijective. All six centered target blocks were entrywise equal after the
SO(3) projection. The six scalar blocks had 1,107 entries that were neither
equal nor sign-opposite under unit scaling. This disproves naïve equality but
did not by itself disprove congruence: scalar stabilizer rows can be singleton
or two-row combinations and therefore carry different exact integer norms.
No cone was removed by `118194879`.

SCNet job `118195346`, source commit `7850757`, tested the norm-derived
positive diagonal congruence and disproved it for the scalar blocks. Each
scalar-minus block has 30 rows with norm ratio 1 and 3 rows with ratio 1/2;
all 465 ordinary/ordinary entries pass and all 96 entries touching an
exceptional row fail. Each scalar-plus block has 42 ordinary rows and 6
ratio-1/2 rows; all 903 ordinary/ordinary entries pass and all 273 incident
entries fail. Zero entries were repaired by scaling and there were no sign-
opposite matches. The centered blocks still pass exactly. Therefore the L=2
gate is not authorized: the exceptional scalar rows require a different
multiplicity-basis map or their cones must be retained.

## Exceptional-row search

The next fail-closed gate retains the proved ratio-1 row map and searches the
small exceptional sets only. A target/reference exceptional pair is a
candidate when one nonzero rational signed scale reproduces every mixed entry
against the fixed ordinary rows and squares correctly on the diagonal. An
incrementally pruned bijection search then replays every entry of the
exceptional submatrix. A complete solution proves the exact congruence
`T = D P R Pᵀ D`, where `P` is a permutation and `D` is an invertible real
diagonal matrix. This changes basis inside the SDP cone; it does not constrain
the state. If no solution exists, expanded spin-aware signatures and the full
candidate graph are written before the gate fails.

SCNet L=1 job `118195948`, source `e81c463`, found exactly one solution in
every scalar block. The exceptional permutation is the identity, while every
exceptional row has rational scale 1/2. The affected rows are 16,24,31 in the
33-side scalar-minus blocks and 22,31,38,42,46,48 in the 48-side scalar-plus
blocks. This resolves all 1,107 direct mismatches and leaves zero final
unmatched or opposite entries over 15,822 comparisons. The Euclidean row-norm
ratio 1/2 therefore did not supply the congruence scale via its square root;
the coefficient algebra fixes the scale itself to 1/2. L=1 now authorizes the
separate L=2 truth audit, not cone deletion by itself.

If the gate passes, removing the three duplicate `l=2` copies per group would
change the retained inventory from 2,540,067 to 1,600,017 packed entries while
keeping the maximum side 490. This is an exact formulation hypothesis until
the coefficient job passes; it is not feasibility or spectral-gap evidence.
