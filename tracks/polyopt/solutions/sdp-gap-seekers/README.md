## Challenge

Certified bulk spectral-gap bounds for frustrated spin-1/2 models — compute
upper bounds on the locally non-degenerate bulk gap of infinite systems via the
state-polynomial γ-feasibility SDP hierarchy of arXiv:2606.03836.

Addresses #88 — released by Xiangling Xu (许湘灵) and Jie Wang (王杰), polyopt
track. Issue #88 defines three targets: square J1-J2, Shastry-Sutherland, and
triangular **J1-J2** (g=0.10, 0.12). **This submission addresses the first two
targets and adds a triangular-J1 (J2=0) portability control** that validates
the reduction on a third lattice geometry; the triangular J1-J2 target itself
is not addressed.

## Headline

A finite hierarchy level *upper-bounds* the bulk gap only when its γ-relaxation
is **infeasible** (excluding that gap threshold); feasibility excludes nothing.

**Current certified status: no bulk-gap upper bound has yet been produced.**
At the smallest tractable relaxation level (L=1, d=2) **every tested
γ-relaxation is feasible** — at the Square J1-J2 and Shastry-Sutherland target
points and at the triangular-J1 portability control — so that level is too weak
to bound the gap:

| Model (L=1, d=2) | Reduction used | γ tested | Result | Gap bound |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Square J1-J2 (g=½), Rung A | none (28/4) | 0, ¼, 2 | all OPTIMAL-feasible | — (too weak) |
| Square J1-J2 (g=½), Rung B | D4 quotient (352→5 blocks) | 0, ¼, 0.40, 2 | all OPTIMAL-feasible | — (too weak) |
| Square J1-J2 (g=½), Rung C | full-spin isotypic (703→max side 45) | 0, 2 | OPTIMAL-feasible (exact rational witness at γ=2) | — (too weak) |
| Shastry-Sutherland (g=0.8) | 6-layer full-spin isotypic (703→max side 45) | ½, 1, 2, 4 | all OPTIMAL-feasible | — (too weak) |
| Triangular J1 *(portability control, not an #88 target)* | 6-layer full-spin isotypic (703→max side 45) | 0, 1, 2 | all OPTIMAL-feasible | — (too weak) |

Stronger levels (Square L=1/d=3; Shastry-Sutherland L=2; Square L=2/d=2) were
attempted but hit a compute boundary — none produced a feasibility status. See
**Limitations** for the terminal status of each.

The contribution so far is therefore **method + machinery**: an exact D4
quotient for the square lattice, a six-layer full-spin isotypic reduction that
transfers unchanged to all three geometries (Square, Shastry-Sutherland,
Triangular — they share the identical reduced inventory), and the tractability
analysis that makes the stronger relaxations affordable. Full per-calculation
metadata (the eight issue-#88 fields) lives in [`docs/issue88_metadata.md`](docs/issue88_metadata.md);
the tractability numbers in [`docs/tractability_reduction.md`](docs/tractability_reduction.md).

## Approach

The finite patch is a **local-consistency window**, not a periodic
finite-volume Hamiltonian. Each hierarchy level asks whether an infinite-volume
KMS ground state can have gap ≥ γ; finite-level infeasibility excludes that
threshold, finite-level feasibility does *not* prove gappedness.

Two #88 target models plus a triangular-J1 portability control, all spin-1/2,
on the 3×3 level-1 patch:

- **Square J1-J2 Heisenberg** *(#88 target 1)*, `H=(1/4)Σ_J1(XX+YY+ZZ)+(g/4)Σ_J2(XX+YY+ZZ)`,
  J1=1, g=½.
- **Shastry-Sutherland** *(#88 target 2)*, dimer/plaquette ratio g_square/dimer = 4/5.
- **Triangular J1 Heisenberg** *(portability control, not an #88 target)* —
  J1=1, J2=0 (120° geometrically-frustrated order). The #88 triangular target
  is J1-J2 at g=0.10, 0.12 and is not addressed here.

The decisive engineering step is **exact symmetry reduction** — feasibility-
equivalent reparameterizations of the finite relaxation (group averaging + exact
congruence/isotypic decomposition), verified by fail-closed truth gates over
exact arithmetic. They are *not* restrictions to a physical symmetry sector and
do not change what the relaxation bounds; they change what is tractable. The
headline contrast: Square Rung C needs **~295 GiB** with D4 alone but **~1 GiB**
with the full-spin isotypic reduction — the ~300× drop that makes the stronger
relaxations affordable on ordinary hardware.

## Reproduction

Two routes, as the submission requires.

### Route 1 — quick, solver-free, no SCNet, no Mosek licence

Validates the exact reductions and assembly structurally, without solving any
SDP. Runs on a laptop (exact-arithmetic structural checks only).

```bash
# from the team directory, with the Julia environment active
julia --project=julia-env test/runtests.jl
# the exact spin-reduction truth chain (six layers, all coefficient gates)
julia --project=julia-env test/run_exact_symmetry_reduction_truth.jl
# the D4 coefficient gates for the square lattice (fail-closed)
julia --project=julia-env scripts/check_d4_coefficient_gates.jl
```

These check Hamiltonian invariance, basis closure, per-coefficient covariance,
moment-inventory closure, exact cross-block zeros, row-basis ranks, cone
congruence, and the `W=3M` isotypic relation — the same gates every harvested
solver run passed before Mosek was attached.

### Route 2 — full build + solve (SCNet + Mosek)

Reproduces the harvested γ-scan results. Requires SCNet access, Mosek 11.2,
Julia 1.11.5, and the pinned environment. The runners are parameterized by
environment variables with `$HOME`-relative defaults (no account name or
absolute home path; the Shastry-Sutherland runners assume a checkout layout
under `$HOME` and accept overrides via `JULIA_BIN` / `JULIA_PROJECT` /
`MOSEK_LICENSE` / `MOSEK_BIN_DIR`). Pinned versions,
the external SpectralGap source pin/patch, the SCNet resource allocations, and
exact per-calculation commands are enumerated in
[`docs/reproducibility.md`](docs/reproducibility.md).

```bash
# Square J1-J2 Rung B, D4-quotiented, γ-scan (CONIC_BUILD_SCRIPT selects the builder)
CONIC_BUILD_SCRIPT=scripts/build_square_d4_conic_mof.jl \
  sbatch scripts/square_conic_solve.sbatch

# Shastry-Sutherland / Triangular, full-spin isotypic, γ-scan
sbatch scripts/shastry_sutherland_full_spin_isotypic_solve_xh5.sbatch
sbatch scripts/triangular_gamma_scan_xh5.sbatch
```

Each harvested run records its own `git commit`, `git tree`, source-file
SHA-256s, solver status, dimensions, runtime, and RSS under `evidence/<run>/`.

## Result language (strict)

Per the source method and the review discipline:

- `OPTIMAL` + `FEASIBLE_POINT` is a **numerical feasibility** statement, never a
  certified gap bound. It is reported as "not produced" with the reason
  (feasible at all tested γ ⇒ excludes no γ).
- A solver `infeasible` is only a **candidate** until independently certified
  (exact dual-infeasibility / rational ray replay). No such transition has
  occurred yet.
- No row in any table claims a certified bulk-gap bound unless it carries an
  audited infeasibility certificate.

## Limitations

- **No certified bound at d=2.** The L=1/d=2 level is feasible across all tested
  γ at both target points (and the triangular control), so it is too weak
  regardless of how cheaply it solves.
- **Partial result — two of three #88 targets, no bound.** Stronger relaxations
  are the route to a bound but hit a compute boundary, not a pending status:
  - *Square L=1/d=3* — exact cone-reduced MOF build completed (job `118201670`);
    **no solve was run**.
  - *Shastry-Sutherland L=2/d=2* — model built (PSD blocks reduced 38→26, packed
    entries 2.54M→1.6M via an exact SO(3) l=2 cone-congruence proof); **Mosek
    exhausted memory during factor fill before iteration zero** — no feasibility
    status.
  - *Square L=2/d=2* — **failed closed at an exact cone-redundancy gate**; no
    MOF or solve.
- **Triangular J1-J2 target not addressed.** Issue #88's triangular target is
  J1-J2 at g=0.10, 0.12; only a J1-only (J2=0) portability control is included
  (full provenance under `evidence/triangular-j1-scan-23012955/`).
- **D4 E-cone.** The Square D4 builder emits the E isotypic block at side `2 n_E`
  rather than the Schur-optimal `n_E`; exact but redundant (an efficiency gap,
  not a correctness defect).
- **Environment self-containment.** The SDP Julia project lives at `julia-env/`
  under this team directory (the repo-root shared project is left untouched).
  `Manifest.toml` is gitignored; a clean checkout requires reconstructing the
  `SpectralGap.jl` path dependency at pinned commit `a1171c9` with
  `spectralgap_a1171c9.patch` (see [`docs/reproducibility.md`](docs/reproducibility.md)
  for the exact sequence) before `Pkg.instantiate`.
